STItemPicker
==========

A generic, data-drive, multi-level, master-detail item picker controller; similar in looks to MPMediaPickerController. Configurable by adopting a simple data source protocol (see `ItemPickerDataSource.h`).

The `ItemPickerSource` folder has all required source code.  `DataSources` contains sample data source implementations.  `TestViewController` shows how to setup and display the ItemPicker.

Run in the Simulator to get an idea of how the ItemPicker looks like.

This project uses submodules; you need to run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` before building.
